Hey I'm UÄŸurcan ðŸ‘‹

It's not always straightforward to pronounce my name, so let me help you. In short, it's pronounced roughly as "Oo-oor-jahn" in English phonetics.

But, if you want to do it properly, let's break it down. It's a compound Turkish word made from "UÄŸur" and "Can".

* **UÄŸur** : The "U" is like the double "o" in "moon," but it's a little shorter. The "ÄŸ" is a soft g, and it's not a sound that's typically found in English. It lengthens the vowel before it, so "uÄŸ" is a prolonged "oo" sound. The "ur" is pronounced like the "ur" in "fur" or "purse."
* **can** : The "c" in Turkish is pronounced like the "j" in "jam." The "a" is pronounced like the "a" in "father," and the "n" is as in English.

Just the "can" works perfectly fine too. ðŸ˜‰

So far, I lived in 3 cities in Turkey, and moved to ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. The first one is the one that I was born and raised, TekirdaÄŸ. It's a lovely city located at the northern west part of Turkey, on the north coast of the Sea of Marmara, in the region of East Thrace. It's primarily known for RakÄ±, Meatballs, and Sunflowers. *And yes, it's close to Ä°stanbul.* 

After that, I moved to Edirne for the high-school and stayed there 4 years. Not far from TekirdaÄŸ, it's still in the Thrace region. Edirne is the European border town of Turkey, adjecent to Greece and Bulgaria. 

Then I moved to Ankara, the capital city, to study electrical and electronics engineering at METU. I stayed there long enough to meet amazing people, deep dive into computers/electronics, and initiate my career as a software engineer.
